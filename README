libloadorder
============

libloadorder is a free software library for manipulating the load order and
active status of plugins for TES III: Morrowind, TES IV: Oblivion,
TES V: Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.

Please see the HTML readme file at docs/libloadorder-readme.html for
more information.


Build Instructions
==================

Note: These build instructions are a work in progress, as I have
recently switched from Windows 7 to Ubuntu. Sorry about that. Currently
my knowledge is limited to compiling for Linux and cross-compiling for
Windows. The whole point of using CMake is that you should be able to
generate MSVC project files from it though.

Note: All paths are given relative to the top directory of the
libloadorder source (ie. where this README is).


Requirements:

  * CMake
    - <http://cmake.org/>
    - Tested with v2.8.9.
  * Boost C++ Libraries
    - <http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/>
    - Download the latest 7-zipped source code.
    - Tested with v1.51.0.
  * UTF8-CPP
    - <http://sourceforge.net/projects/utfcpp/>
    - Download the latest zipped v2.x source code.
    - Tested with v2.3.2.
  * A native build system of your choice.
    - Tested with GNU Make on Ubuntu Linux 12.10.


Preparing UTF8-CPP:
  1. Create a 'utf8' folder inside the 'externals' folder.
  2. Place the folders inside the UTF8-CPP archive you downloaded (should be
     'source', 'doc') into the 'utf8' folder.


Preparing Boost:
  1. Create a 'boost' folder inside the 'externals' folder.
  2. Extract the downloaded Boost archive to your 'boost' folder, so that
     (for example) 'b2.exe' is at 'externals/boost/b2.exe'.


Building libloadorder
---------------------

Open a Terminal window and navigate to the root of the liblibloadorder
source.

    cd externals/boost
    ./bootstrap.sh
    echo "" > tools/build/v2/user-config.jam
    ./b2 toolset=gcc link=static variant=release address-model=32 cxxflags=-fPIC --with-filesystem --with-locale --with-regex --with-program_options --with-system --stagedir=stage-32
    mkdir ../../build
    cd ../../build
    cmake .. -DLIBLO_ARCH=32 -DLIBLO_LINK=STATIC
    make


For cross-compiling to Windows:

    cd externals/boost
    ./bootstrap.sh
    echo "using gcc : 4.6.3 : i586-mingw32msvc-g++ : <rc>i586-mingw32msvc-windres <archiver>i586-mingw32msvc-ar <ranlib>i586-mingw32msvc-ranlib ;" > tools/build/v2/user-config.jam
    ./b2 toolset=gcc-4.6.3 target-os=windows link=static variant=release address-model=32 cxxflags=-fPIC --with-filesystem --with-locale --with-regex --with-program_options --with-system --stagedir=stage-mingw-32
    mkdir ../../build
    cd ../../build
    cmake .. -DLIBLO_ARCH=32 -DLIBLO_LINK=STATIC -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=mingw32-toolchain.cmake
    make

If both native and cross-compiling, you'll need to delete the 'build'
folder otherwise CMake will get confused and only build one of them (it
doesn't seem to overwrite all the necessary config files when it
generates the build system the second time).

To compile a shared library, swap -DLIBSTR_LINK=STATIC with
-DLIBSTR_LINK=SHARED

To compile a 64 bit library, replace all instances of "32" in the above
commands with "64". Also replace all instances of "i586-mingw32msvc"
in the echo command with "x86_64-w64-mingw32".
