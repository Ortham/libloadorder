//! # libloadorder-ffi
//!
//! libloadorder-ffi provides a C API wrapper around libloadorder, a free software library for
//! manipulating the load order and active status of plugins for the following games:
//!
//! - TES III: Morrowind
//! - TES IV: Oblivion
//! - TES V: Skyrim
//! - TES V: Skyrim Special Edition
//! - TES V: Skyrim VR
//! - Fallout 3
//! - Fallout: New Vegas
//! - Fallout 4
//! - Fallout 4 VR
//! - Starfield
//! - OpenMW
//!
//! ## Variable Types
//!
//! libloadorder-ffi uses character strings and integers for information input/output.
//!
//! - All strings are null-terminated byte character strings encoded in UTF-8.
//! - All return, game and load order method codes are unsigned integers at least 16 bits in size.
//! - All array sizes are unsigned integers at least 16 bits in size.
//! - File paths are case-sensitive if and only if the underlying file system is case-sensitive.
//!
//! ## Thread Safety
//!
//! libloadorder-ffi is thread-safe. Reading and writing data for a single game handle is protected
//! by a reader-writer lock, and error messages are stored thread-locally.
//!
//! Game handles operate independently, so using more than one game handle for a single game across
//! multiple threads is not advised, as filesystem changes made when writing data are not atomic
//! and data races may occur under such usage.
//!
//! ## Data Caching
//!
//! libloadorder caches plugin data to improve performance. Each game handle has its own unique
//! cache, which is cleared when
//!
//! - calling `lo_load_current_state()`
//! - calling `lo_fix_plugin_lists()`
//! - an error is encountered writing a change.
//!
//! ## Plugin Validity
//!
//! Where libloadorder functions take one or more plugin filenames, it checks that these filenames
//! correspond to valid plugins. libloadorder defines a valid plugin as one that:
//!
//! - Ends with `.esp`, `.esm`, `.esp.ghost` or `.esm.ghost` (or `.esl` or `.esl.ghost` for Skyrim
//!   Special Edition, Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 VR).
//! - Contains a header record with:
//!
//!     - The correct type (`TES3` for Morrowind, `TES4` otherwise).
//!     - A size that is not larger than the total file size.
//!     - Subrecords with sizes that do not together sum to larger than the expected total
//!       subrecords size.
//!
//! When the game is OpenMW:
//!
//! - `.omwgame`, `.omwaddon` and `.omwscripts` plugins are also supported. `.omwgame` and
//!   `.omwaddon` plugins must be valid according to the same rules as Morrowind `.esm` and `.esp`
//!   plugins. The contents of `.omwscripts` plugins are not used by libloadorder.
//! - `.esm.ghost` and `.esp.ghost` are not valid plugin filename extensions.
//!
//! This definition is substantially more permissive than games or other utilities may be for
//! performance reasons, and because libloadorder uses no plugin data beyond the header record, so
//! later corruption or invalid data would not affect its behaviour.
//!
//! This permissivity does allow more strictly invalid plugins to be positioned in the load order
//! and activated, which may cause game issues, but protecting against such circumstances is beyond
//! the scope of libloadorder.
//!
//! ## Valid Load Orders
//!
//! Any load order that is set using libloadorder must meet all the following conditions:
//!
//! - Contains only installed plugins.
//! - Contains no duplicate entries.
//! - Loads all master files (including light masters and false-flagged plugins) before all plugin
//!   files, with the exception that a non-master file that is a master of a master file must load
//!   between that master file and the previous master file. Note that OpenMW treats all plugins as
//!   non-master files.
//! - Contains no more than 255 active plugins, excluding light plugins.
//! - Contains no more than 4096 active light plugins.
//! - Contains all the game's implicitly active plugins that are installed (e.g. `Skyrim.esm` and
//!   `Update.esm` for Skyrim).
//! - Starts with the game's main master file (Skyrim, Skyrim SE, Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 VR only).
//!
//! Libloadorder considers a load order that fulfills all the above conditions to be valid, though
//! there may be additional conditions that may be enforced by the game.
//!
//! Libloadorder is less strict when loading load orders and will adjust them at load time to be
//! valid, similar to game behaviour. The exception to this adjustment is that the set of active
//! plugins is not reduced in size if too many plugins are active, so that it is preserved when
//! changing the order in which plugins are loaded. As such, while libloadorder will refuse to
//! activate too many plugins, it will preserve a load order that already has too many plugins
//! activated.
