Initial release of libloadorder-ffi. The changes listed below are relative to
the previous libloadorder C API.

### Added

- `lo_load_current_state()` must be used to load load order state before
  operating on it for the first time, and reload it whenever there are external
  changes made to the load order.
- `lo_free_string()` must be used to free the memory allocated by any API
  function that outputs a C string, excluding `lo_get_error_message()`.
- `lo_free_string_array()` must be used to free the memory allocated by any API
  function that outputs an array of C strings.
- New C API error codes:

  - `LIBLO_ERROR_POISONED_THREAD_LOCK`
  - `LIBLO_ERROR_IO_ERROR`
  - `LIBLO_ERROR_IO_PERMISSION_DENIED`
  - `LIBLO_ERROR_TEXT_ENCODE_FAIL`
  - `LIBLO_ERROR_TEXT_DECODE_FAIL`
  - `LIBLO_ERROR_INTERNAL_LOGIC_ERROR`

### Changed

- libloadorder has been rewritten in Rust. The library has been split into two
  crates: `libloadorder`, which contains the Rust implementation, and
  `libloadorder-ffi`, which contains the FFI wrapper.
- Memory allocation failure now causes a panic instead of returning an error
  code.
- C strings and arrays of C strings output by API game handle functions now have
  indefinite lifetime and must be explicitly freed using the provided API
  functions. Previous behaviour was that such output would be stored in
  thread-local storage until the next time the same data type was outputted, or
  until the associated game handle was destroyed.
- The API functions no longer manage the library's load order cache, instead
  exposing control to the client via `lo_load_current_state()`.
- The C string output of `lo_get_error_message()` no longer needs to be
  explicitly freed.
- The C/C++ headers have been replaced with one C header (`libloadorder.h`) and
  one C++ header (`libloadorder.hpp`).
- Many API function parameters have lost `const` qualifiers due to the C/C++
  headers being autogenerated and changes to string ownership.
- The library binary name has changed. Omitting
  platform-specific prefixes and suffixes, it is now `loadorder_ffi`.
- The documentation has been converted to Markdown and split up: the API
  reference documentation is stored with the code and generated by rustdoc, and
  the general load order documentation is now stored in `/doc` and generated
  by [mdBook](https://azerupi.github.io/mdBook/).

### Removed

- `lo_set_game_master()` was removed as it had no effect.
- `lo_is_compatible()` was removed as it was unnecessary as the library uses
  semantic versioning.
- `lo_cleanup()` was removed as it was made obsolete.
- Some error codes were removed or replaced:

  - `LIBLO_WARN_BAD_FILENAME` is now indicated by `LIBLO_ERROR_TEXT_ENCODE_FAIL`
  - `LIBLO_ERROR_FILE_READ_FAIL` is now indicated by `LIBLO_ERROR_IO_ERROR`
  - `LIBLO_ERROR_FILE_WRITE_FAIL` is now indicated by `LIBLO_ERROR_IO_ERROR`,
    `LIBLO_ERROR_IO_PERMISSION_DENIED` and `LIBLO_ERROR_TEXT_DECODE_FAIL`
  - `LIBLO_ERROR_TIMESTAMP_READ_FAIL` is now indicated by `LIBLO_ERROR_IO_ERROR`
  - `LIBLO_ERROR_NO_MEM` is obsolete as the Rust implementation panics on
    memory allocation failure
  - `LIBLO_WARN_INVALID_LIST` was unused for a few major versions
